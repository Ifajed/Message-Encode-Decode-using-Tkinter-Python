# Message-Encode-Decode-using-Tkinter-Python
Python offers multiple option for developing GUI. Out of all the GUI methds. It is a standard python interface to method. It is a standard python interface to the TK GUI toolkit shipped with python. Python with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way ti create the GUI application. 


Python provides the TKINTER toolkit to develop GUI application. Now its upto the imagination of necessity of developer, what he/she want to develop using this toolkit. Let's try to implement a message encryption-decryption application according to the VIGENERE cipher, which can encrypt he mesage using the key and can decrypt the ecrypted hash using same key.




 MODULES USED IN THE PROJECT:

                           1. TKINTER  -->  GUI TOOLKIT


                           2. TIME


                           3. DATETIME


                           4. BASE64  -->  VIGENERE CIPHER





BELOW IS THE IMPLEMETATION OF ABOVE IDEA OF MESSAGE ENCODE USING TKINTER
